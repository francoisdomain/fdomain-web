      title: "Oops! Hearing, Not Listening. üö®",
      description: `
      You might be **physically present** in conversations, but your mind is often elsewhere‚Äîscrolling, zoning out, or just waiting for the other person to stop talking. This can lead to **misunderstandings, missed details, and frustrated colleagues** who feel unheard.
      
      **How to Improve:**
      
        - **Remove distractions** (put your phone away, close emails, mute notifications) before important discussions.
        - Practice **mindfulness**‚Äîwhen you catch your mind drifting, bring it back to the conversation.
        - Use **body language** to stay engaged: nod, maintain eye contact, and react naturally.
        - **Summarize key points** to confirm you understood correctly (e.g., *So you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶*).
        - Ask at least one **follow-up question** in every conversation to show you‚Äôre invested.
        
        **Small changes will make a huge difference!**

      title: "Selective Listener üò¨",
      description: `
      You hear words, but are you **really listening**? You might get the gist of what people say, but you‚Äôre more focused on what you‚Äôll say next than truly understanding. This can lead to **rushed responses, assumptions, or missing key details**.
      
      **How to Improve:**
      
      - **Pause** before responding‚Äîlet the other person‚Äôs words sink in before jumping in with a reply.
      - **Paraphrase occasionally** to confirm understanding (e.g., *Just to make sure I got this right, you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶*).
      - **Resist the urge to interrupt**‚Äîeven if you think you know where they‚Äôre going, let them finish.
      - Be **genuinely curious**‚Äîshift from *How will I respond?* to *What can I learn from this?*
      
      Being **fully present** will make people feel heard‚Äîand you‚Äôll avoid misunderstandings!

      description: `
      You‚Äôre engaged in conversations, but sometimes your focus drifts‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre eager to share your own thoughts. While you generally listen well, you could be even better at making people feel truly understood.
      
      **How to Improve:**
      
      - Ask **open-ended questions** to deepen discussions (e.g., *Can you tell me more about that?*).
      - **Mirror emotions**‚Äîif they‚Äôre frustrated, acknowledge it (*I can see why that‚Äôs frustrating*).
      - **Resist solution mode** too quickly‚Äîsometimes, people just need to be heard before jumping into fixes.
      - **Take notes** during key meetings to keep focus and retention high.
      
      You‚Äôre close to mastering active listening‚Äîjust a little more **fine-tuning** will take you to the **next level**!

      description: `
      **You‚Äôre a conversation MVP**! People love talking to you because you make them feel heard and valued. You engage, respond thoughtfully, and ask great questions. This helps you build stronger relationships, solve problems faster, and earn trust.
      
      **How to Stay Sharp:**
      
      - **Keep practicing** active listening techniques, even when you‚Äôre tired or distracted.
      - **Adapt** your listening style‚Äîsome people need advice, others just need to vent. Recognizing the difference makes you an even better communicator.
      - **Teach others**‚Äîhelp your team improve their listening skills by setting the example.
      - Use **silence as a tool**‚Äîsometimes, the best response is just a thoughtful pause.
      
      Your ability to truly listen will **set you apart as a leader, mentor, and trusted colleague**!
